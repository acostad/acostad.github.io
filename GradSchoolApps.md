## Advice on Applying to Graduate School in Physics, by D.Acosta
- Line up your potential reference letter writers early, and make sure that they get to know you. 
- When you do contact writers, share your application material (including transcript if you are comfortable with that)
   - Often letter writers are asked to fill in surveys ranking you in areas such as: intellectual ability, writing, speaking, motivation, creativity, maturity, teaching 
- Graduate school is for a specific apprenticeship. Outreach and extra curricular activities can and do look good, but you don't have to overdo it (unless applying to medical school). It is not like applying to undergraduate programs.
   - 	The committee will look at how you did in your physics and math classes, and any research experience, to see if you have a good chance to succeed
   - 	Everything else is bonus
- Try to focus your research statement: why do you want to go to grad school and why this particular area (s)? Long life story is not really necessary.
- Remind people that Rice is a premier, highly selective institution! You worked hard, but sadly not every place is aware of that actually...
- If you have any blemish on your transcript, try to address it in personal statement (turn it around into a positive if you can)
- Taylor your letter to the institution and faculty as best you can (make sure the information you look up is recent. Maybe Prof. X has retired...)
- Larger departments have more areas of research, so are better if you decide to change your mind
   - But still, your area of interest should be among those listed
	- Ultimately you end up choosing an advisor you can work with, and sometimes that may not match with your initial interests
- Prior research experience is definitely a plus. Get involved now if you haven't already.
- If you have done some research, sign up for a poster session or talk at a relevant conference (e.g. GCURS). This looks good to list, and there may be potential advisors in the audience!
- All departments will have some quota they can admit. Some might be fine-grained into each subdiscipline (like Rice P&A), so be clear which areas you are applying to), and for others it is overall (like U.Florida). For the latter, you may be able to get in and have a chance for field X, but be careful. Best to ask a department member in that field if they are taking students before you accept an offer)
- Make sure your subdiscipline interest is in the specific department. 
- Apply to multiple places, from "reach" to  "safety"
